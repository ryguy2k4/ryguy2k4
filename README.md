## Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan Sponzilli and I am a junior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am pursuing a dual degree: Astronomy + Data Science, BSLAS; and Geophysics, BS. Iâ€™m pursuing a data-oriented career with specific interests in data analytics, research, astronomy, and geology. Through my Astronomy + Data Science degree, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on research experience and developed strong technical skills. My second degree in Geophysics deepens my understanding of Earth systems and complements my astronomy background. I regularly work with Python (pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, astropy) and have experience using Tableau, Power BI, Docker, GitHub, and SQL. My Github portfolio features several in-depth, self-driven projects that apply these tools to data analysis. Check out my pinned repositories to see some of my projects! Iâ€™m driven by my natural curiosity to ask questions and seek an in-depth understanding of new concepts, Iâ€™m always looking to learn something new, and Iâ€™m always willing to collaborate and learn from peers and mentors.
